#Star Wars

Make a few choices from the options offered by C3PO to see what he recommends to watch this evening!

jQuery animations are used; Mouse control/WASD + Enter;

I want to add: 
1)Change fighter on click;
2)Collection and display of statistics;
3)Disable the fighter's ability to move while firing;
4)Make the page shrink resistant on Ctrl + mousewheel;
